// This component will contain the form to create a new test.
// The logic will be very similar to the BlogEditor component:
// 1. Use useState for all fields (title, topic, subject, etc.).
// 2. Have a handleSubmit function that makes a POST request to '/api/admin/mock-tests'.
// 3. Display a status message.
// We are keeping it brief here, but you would implement a full form.

export default function MockTestManager() {
  // ... state and submit handler for creating a new test
  return <form>{/* All form inputs for test metadata */}</form>;
